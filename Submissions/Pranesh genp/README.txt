Storyline:
CUBESPEEDING is a game made by Pranesh in which your aim is to cross through the area without colliding with any of the obstacles placed by Mr.Grumpy. Mr. Grumpy is a old man who's assigned the task to train you in CubeSpeeding. His clock doesn't stop unless you collide with someone so no excuse of pausing in between. And in case if you feel tired (Mr.Grumpy never gets tired) and you want to give up press q. Mr.Grumpy is a WASD guy. So use WASD for controls. And, now its a open challenge to CubeSpeed in the lowest time possible. Remember the clock keeps running.

Controls:
W - Move forward
A - Move backward
S - Move left
D - Move right
q - Quit[:(]

How To Play:
The game opens with a home screen with a option to start the challenge. Then the timer begins and you have to use the controls given above to avoid obstacles and move. If you hit any obstacle or fall from the area the game will restart. Once the level ends your score will be displayed on the right. And you can either restart to achieve a better score or press q to end.
